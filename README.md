 ## IDEA

**A city of zero waste besides smart revenue outcomes by tuning the citizenâ€™s activity.** This project aims to revolutionize waste management by integrating technology to facilitate segregating biodegradable and plastic waste from households. Users are incentivized through a dedicated app that provides a marketplace for second-hand goods.
### Key Features:
#### 1. Waste Segregation:
- A smart dustbin equipped with image classification capabilities to automatically sort waste that hasn't been pre-separated.
- Utilizes Raspberry Pi as a microcontroller for real-time processing.
#### 2. Internet of Things (IoT) Integration:
- Smart dustbins send signals to a web server to indicate when they are full.
- Waste collection trucks are dispatched based on these signals.
#### 3. User Rewards and Marketplace:
- Users earn rewards for proper waste segregation through the app.
- The app also features a marketplace where users can buy and sell second-hand goods.
#### 4. Waste Utilization:
- Biodegradable waste is processed into fertilizer.
- Plastic waste is converted into fuel (such as aviation kerosene and petrol).

### Technical Implementation
#### 1. Smart Dustbin
- **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi
- **Image Classification:** Utilized for waste sorting
- **IoT Functionality:** Real-time status updates sent to the web server
#### 2. App Development
- **User Rewards System** Encourages proper waste segregation
- **Second-hand Goods Marketplace:** Facilitates the buying and selling of used items
#### 3. Waste Conversion
- **Biodegradable Waste:** Converted into fertilizer
- **Plastic Waste:** Transformed into fuel
    - This part of the project was developed with the expertise of three team members from the chemistry department, two of whom conducted lab work on fuel production from plastic waste.

## Selection
**At first, we were selected as one of the Top 100 teams in the country**. A few days later, we received an email notifying us that our team was selected as one of the **Top 30 teams**, and another contest was arranged for these teams. Unfortunately, I lost the email confirming our Top 30 selection. Here is the email confirming our selection into the Top 100-
