 ## IDEA

**A city of zero waste besides smart revenue outcomes by tuning the citizenâ€™s activity.** The Idea was to collect biodegradable and plastic waste separately from home, reward users with an app, and also the user can purchase second-hand goods from this app. Smart Dustbin for the waste that is not separated and can be split by using this dustbin, the idea was to use **image classification** to separate the wastes and **Raspberry Pi**  as a microcontroller. Using **IOT** in a smart dustbin sent a signal to the web server that it is full or not, a truck will respond to that signal and pick up the waste. Now the biodegradable waste will be used as a fertilizer and plastic waste will be used as a raw material of **FUEL** like **Aviation kerosene**,**Patrol**, etc. As our three team members were from the chemistry department and two of them did some Lab work on how to produce **FUEL** from plastic waste, they helped to complete that part of the project.
